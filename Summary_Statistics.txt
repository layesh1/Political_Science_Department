SCHOOL VOUCHER SURVEY — RESEARCH SUMMARY STATISTICS
Fall 2025 | UNC Charlotte Sample
================================================================
Total Respondents: N = 1,005
Data collected via survey experiment with random assignment
to framing conditions (Specialty vs. Equity frame).
================================================================

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BLOCK 1: PUBLIC AWARENESS & GENERAL SUPPORT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

These variables establish baseline awareness and attitudes
toward school voucher policies in the general public.

1. STATE PROGRAM AWARENESS (VinState, n = 1,005)
   Does the respondent believe their state offers a voucher program?

   Yes              29.7%
   No               17.9%
   Not sure         52.4%

   >> Note: The majority of respondents (52.4%) were
   uncertain whether their state had a voucher program, indicating
   low public awareness of existing policy — relevant for framing
   how informed public opinion actually is on this issue.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. SELF-REPORTED KNOWLEDGE (VKnow, n = 1,002)

   Not knowledgeable at all     49.4%
   Somewhat knowledgeable       45.4%
   Very knowledgeable            5.2%

   >> Nearly half of respondents report no
   knowledge of voucher policy at all. Only 5.2% report high
   familiarity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. GENERAL POLICY SUPPORT (Vsupport, n = 1,005)

   Strongly oppose          19.0%
   Somewhat oppose          16.0%
   Not sure or neutral      18.0%
   Somewhat support         28.6%
   Strongly support         18.4%

   Net support (somewhat + strongly): 47.0%
   Net opposition (somewhat + strongly): 35.0%

   >> Note: Support for school vouchers outpaces
   opposition by roughly 12 points in this national sample,
   with a notable 18% remaining neutral. The distribution
   suggests a policy with majority-leaning support but
   significant polarization. Neither a consensus nor a
   fringe position.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BLOCK 2: PERCEIVED EFFECTS ON SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Respondents evaluated whether voucher policies benefit or harm
six distinct groups. Scale: 1 (greatly harmed) → 5 (greatly benefit).
Condensed into % Harmed vs. % Benefit for interpretability.

                        % Harmed    % Neutral    % Benefit
   Poor families          32.0%       16.0%        51.9%
   Wealthy families        6.6%       36.0%        57.4%
   Religious families      3.3%       37.5%        59.2%
   Urban families         21.9%       25.9%        52.1%
   Rural families         28.0%       30.3%        41.7%
   Students w/ disabilities 21.9%     31.2%        46.9%

   >> Research note — Key contrasts worth highlighting:

   - WEALTHY vs. POOR GAP: Respondents see wealthy families as
     the clearest beneficiaries (57.4% benefit), but opinions
     on poor families are the most divided of any group (32%
     harmed vs. 52% benefit). This ambivalence about equity
     effects mirrors the core normative debate in the voucher
     literature.

   - RURAL PENALTY: Rural families receive the lowest net
     benefit rating (41.7%) and the second-highest harm rating
     (28.0%), suggesting the public intuitively recognizes
     geographic access barriers — private school availability
     is concentrated in urban/suburban areas.

   - STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: 21.9% believe SWD are harmed,
     reflecting awareness that private schools are not subject
     to the same IDEA obligations as public schools. Yet 46.9%
     still see a net benefit, indicating public uncertainty
     about disability rights implications of voucher policy.

   - RELIGIOUS FAMILIES: Seen as the most likely beneficiaries
     (59.2% benefit, only 3.3% harmed), consistent with the
     prominent role of faith-based schools in voucher programs.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BLOCKS 3 & 4: FRAMING EXPERIMENT RESULTS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DESIGN: Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two
framing conditions. The SPECIALTY frame emphasized school
choice and the ability of private schools to serve students
better. The EQUITY frame emphasized exclusivity and the
potential for vouchers to favor some families over others.

Respondents then rated whether three school types should be
eligible to participate in voucher programs.

SCALE: 1 = Definitely eligible → 5 = Definitely NOT eligible
(Higher scores = greater support for restricting eligibility)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCHOOL TYPE 1: HIGH-TUITION SCHOOL
(Voucher covers half tuition; Equity frame added "leaving it
unaffordable to others")

   Specialty frame:  M = 2.16  (SD = 1.24,  n = 502)
   Equity frame:     M = 2.90  (SD = 1.39,  n = 501)
   Difference:       +0.74 points toward restriction

   Independent samples t-test: t(1001) = -8.856, p < .001 ***

   >> Statistically significant. The equity framing made
   respondents substantially more likely to oppose eligibility
   for high-tuition schools. Effect size is meaningful —
   roughly half a standard deviation shift.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCHOOL TYPE 2: RELIGIOUS SCHOOL
(Equity frame added "does not admit students who follow other
values, beliefs, and lifestyles")

   Specialty frame:  M = 3.16  (SD = 1.48,  n = 503)
   Equity frame:     M = 3.61  (SD = 1.42,  n = 501)
   Difference:       +0.45 points toward restriction

   Independent samples t-test: t(1002) = -4.845, p < .001 ***

   >> Statistically significant, though the smallest effect
   of the three school types. Opinions on religious schools
   were already more divided under the specialty frame
   (M = 3.16, near neutral), suggesting pre-existing
   ambivalence about religious school eligibility that is
   further nudged by exclusion framing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCHOOL TYPE 3: SELECTIVE COGNITIVE SCHOOL
(Specialty: "specializes in serving students of high
intelligence"; Equity frame added "does not admit students of
lower or impaired cognitive abilities")

   Specialty frame:  M = 2.15  (SD = 1.17,  n = 502)
   Equity frame:     M = 3.09  (SD = 1.37,  n = 502)
   Difference:       +0.94 points toward restriction

   Independent samples t-test: t(1002) = -11.749, p < .001 ***

   >> Largest framing effect of the three. Explicitly naming
   the exclusion of students with lower or impaired cognitive
   abilities produced the strongest public backlash. Nearly
   a full scale point shift. This is particularly notable
   given the SWD harm findings in Block 2, suggesting the
   public is especially responsive to disability exclusion
   when it is made salient.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OVERALL EXPERIMENT SUMMARY

   All three framing effects significant at p < .001.
   Direction consistent: equity framing increases support
   for restricting school eligibility in all cases.

   Ranked by effect size (mean difference):
   1. Selective Cognitive School   Δ = 0.94  (largest)
   2. High-Tuition School          Δ = 0.74
   3. Religious School             Δ = 0.45  (smallest)

   >> Note: The consistency of the framing effect
   across all three school types, and especially its
   strength for the selective cognitive school, supports
   the conclusion that how voucher policies are framed
   significantly shapes public willingness to restrict
   eligibility. This has direct implications for advocacy,
   messaging strategy, and legislative framing in the
   voucher debate.
